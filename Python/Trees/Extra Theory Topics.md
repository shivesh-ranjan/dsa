# Extra Theoretical Topics:
## 1) Heap:
### A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:
* Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
* Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

<H2> 2) Self Balancing Trees:
<H3> Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees are height-balanced binary search trees that automatically keeps height as small as possible when insertion and deletion operations are performed on tree. The height is typically maintained in order of Log n so that all operations take O(Log n) time on average.
